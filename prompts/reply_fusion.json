Do NOT drop important constraints, warnings, steps, or conclusions.\n  - Keep it short and clear. Prefer 1-3 segments unless truly necessary.\n  - Do NOT include markdown fences.\n  - You MUST include <resources></resources> (keep it empty).\n  - Do NOT use narrator/workflow phrases in the fused reply (e.g., \"根据你的请求\", \"工具调用\", \"系统提示\", \"工作流\", \"MCP\", \"函数\", \"prompt\", \"schema\"); write as direct human chat.\n</rules>\n"
